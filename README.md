# 🚗 Auto MPG Data Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between car attributes such as weight, horsepower, and cylinders with fuel efficiency (miles per gallon - MPG).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and process raw data using Python
- Explore relationships between car features and MPG
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Identify key insights from correlation analysis

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 💡 Key Insights
- Heavier cars tend to have **lower MPG**
- Cars with more cylinders generally consume more fuel
- **Horsepower** and **weight** are strongly negatively correlated with MPG
